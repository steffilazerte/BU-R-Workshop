# Brandon University R Workshop

This is the repo for the annual BU R workshop


Two-day R workshop focusing on R for data management

Instructor: Dr. Steffi LaZerte

Running statistics in R, while difficult, is made even more so by the challenge
of using R to manipulate data. This workshop therefore focuses on teaching the
use of RStudio and the tidyverse suite of packages (e.g., ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr,
etc.) to create figures and data visualizations, load, clean and summarize data,
and generally troubleshoot R. Each day includes an hour for you to work on your
own data, wherein you can take advantage of the instructorâ€™s expertise to work
through your own R problems and learn how to do analyses specific to your work.
This workshop is geared towards raw beginners, those with a basic familiarity
with R, and towards intermediate R users unfamiliar with the tidyverse suite of
packages or those wanting to up their game.
